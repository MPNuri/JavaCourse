                      Array vs ArrayLists

         - Array is a fixed-length data structure, we cannot change length of Array once we initialize
           Arraylist is resizeable (Dynamic Array)

         - Arraylist (-unlike Array-) cannot contain Primitive types // this one is important

         - Also we can compare Array and ArrayList on how to calculate size
           We use (.length()) method for Arrays, (size()) method for Arraylist

         - Arraylist is part of a collection framework. Arrays are part of core java programing
