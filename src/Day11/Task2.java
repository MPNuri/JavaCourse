        1-) First find the range length here is from -10 to 10 so 20
        that means we are going to multiply by 20
        2-) Find the asken point negative positive or zero
        3-) Multiply the length with Math.random() method
        4-) Look how much you need to add or subtract, so you can reach the highest point.
