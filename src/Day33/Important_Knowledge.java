    /**    1-) Class vs Object
     * 1.1-) Class is a prototype (template), and using those templates we create objects
       1.2-) Objects are instances of prototype

     *     2-) Instance Variable vs Static Variable
     * 2.1-) Static variable or methods belong to class itself but instance variables are belongs to objects

     *    3-) Constructor
     * 3.1-) Special Methods which is called when we create a new object
     * 3.2-) Constructor used to initialize to objects.
     * 3.3-) Constructors created by the same name as their class

     *    4-) Constructor vs Method
     * 4.1-) Constructors created by the same name as their class. --- Methods can have any name.
     * 4.2-) Constructors created automatically. --- Methods are created manually
     * 4.3-) Constructors do not have return. --- Methods have returns
     * 4.4-) Constructors used to initialize objects. --- Methods used to perform actions (functions).
