    /** question 1
     * 1-) What does it mean that "Java is platform independent"
     * answer 1-) we can write our code in mac then run it under Microsoft Window

     * 2-) What does Java IDE mean?
     * answer 2-) Integrated Development Environment,
     *            there are two main IDEa. one is intellij, other is eclipse

     * 3-) Can you define Constructors?
     * answer 3-) It is necessary to create an object.
     *            It must have the same as its class.
     *            Constructors can be overloaded but not overwrite.

     * 4-) What does OOP concept mean?
     * answer 4-) encapsulation
     *            abstraction
     *            inheritance
     *            polymorphism = method overloading, method overriding

     * 5-) what does Overloading mean?
     * answer 5-) using the same method while changing the parameter
     *            Static is overloading, dynamic is overriding
     *            Overloading is compiled time Polymorphism and overriding is run time polymorphism

     * 6-) what does Overriding mean?
     * answer 6-) is known as Dynamic or Run time Polymorphism.
     *            overriding is done in the parent child related classes,
     *            while having the same method name and same parameter(same signature).
     *            we can only see the error when we run the code.

     * 7-) Array vs Arraylist
     * answer 7-) Arrays are fixe sized, arraylists are resizeable
     *            so, we have to declare the number of element when we create an array
     *            Arraylist can only store Reference data types.
     *            We can store primitive data types in arraylist by using Wrapper Classes

     * 8-) can you define Access Modifiers and the Types
     * answer 8-) There are 4 types of Access Modifiers
     *            Public = in any class
     *            default = only in the same package
     *            protected = Accessed from same package and from child classes
     *            private = only in the same class

     * 9-) Pre-Increment and Post-Increment
     * answer 9-) Post-Increment = count++; --- first return then increase
     *            Pre-Increment = ++count; --- first increase and then return
